            <div class="intro-grid">
                <div class="intro-text">
                    <p>For years, I lived a double life, viewing pornography and lying to cover it up. I thought I could stop on my own, that if I just tried harder, I'd break free. But the cycle of shame, secrecy, and isolation only deepened. When my wife discovered the truth, I thought I would lose my marriage. That moment became my breaking and turning point. I realized I couldn't do this alone.</p>
                    <p>Three years ago, I found freedom from porn and masturbation, not through willpower, but through connection with God and with other men who understood this battle. I had believed God was irrelevant and the Bible outdated, thinking porn was just a bad habit all men dealt with. But I was wrong. I didn't realize how all encompassing porn had become until I was finally free. I had an intimacy disorder; porn wasn't just a bad habit, it was destroying my ability to truly connect, to love, to live fully.</p>
                    <p>Now, I understand God's plan. I see why sexual sin is so devastating and how it steals the life we were meant to live. Today, I have an amazing marriage. I know joy. I know I'm enough, not because of what I do, but because of who God says I am. I broke free, and you can too. That's why I'm compelled to lead other men down this path to freedom. As someone who's been exactly where you are, I understand this battle from the inside, and I've found a way out through grace.</p>
