                <h2>Agreement to Terms</h2>
                <p>By accessing or using the services of Path to Freedom Coaching LLC ("we," "us," or "our"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you disagree with any part of these terms, you may not access our services.</p>
                
                <h2>Services Description</h2>
                <p>Path to Freedom Coaching provides grace-based Christian coaching services for men seeking freedom from porn and sexual addiction. Our services include individual coaching sessions, access to our Recovery App, resources and educational materials, and email support between sessions.</p>

                <h2>Coaching Relationship</h2>

                <h3>Nature of Coaching</h3>
                <p>Our coaching services are designed to support your personal growth and recovery. However, coaching is not therapy, counseling, or medical treatment. We are not licensed mental health professionals, and coaching does not replace professional medical or psychiatric care. If you need clinical treatment, we will provide appropriate referrals.</p>

                <h3>Client Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>As a coaching client, you agree to be honest and transparent in all communications, take responsibility for your choices and actions, complete agreed-upon action items between sessions, provide 24-hour notice for cancellations or rescheduling, and seek professional help if experiencing a mental health crisis.</p>

                <h2>Payment Terms</h2>

                <h3>Fees and Payment</h3>
                <p>Payment is due at the time of booking. We accept major credit cards via Stripe. Prices are subject to change with 30 days notice, and monthly packages are billed on a recurring basis.</p>

                <h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
                <p>Cancellations must be made at least 24 hours before your scheduled session. Late cancellations (less than 24 hours) will be charged the full session fee, and no-shows will be charged the full session fee. Emergency situations will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>

                <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
                <p>Refunds are not provided for completed sessions. Monthly packages can be cancelled with 7 days notice before the next billing cycle. Unused sessions in cancelled packages are non-refundable, and refund requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.</p>

                <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
                <p>We maintain strict confidentiality of all client information, as detailed in our Privacy Policy. However, confidentiality may be broken in situations involving imminent danger to yourself or others, suspected child abuse or neglect, court orders or legal requirements, or with your explicit written consent.</p>

                <h2>Recovery App Terms</h2>

                <h3>Access and Use</h3>
                <p>App access is provided exclusively to coaching clients. You must maintain the confidentiality of your login credentials and may not share your account with others. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access for violations.</p>

                <h3>Data and Content</h3>
                <p>You retain ownership of content you create in the app. We may use anonymized, aggregated data to improve services, and you are responsible for maintaining backups of important data.</p>

                <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>All content on this website and in our coaching materials, including text, graphics, logos, and images, is the property of Path to Freedom Coaching LLC and is protected by copyright laws.

                <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages. Our total liability is limited to the amount you paid for services. We make no guarantees about specific outcomes or results, and you assume full responsibility for decisions made based on coaching.</p>

                <h2>Medical Disclaimer</h2>
                <p>Our coaching services are not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of qualified health providers with questions regarding medical or mental health conditions. If you are experiencing a mental health crisis, call 988 immediately.</p>

                <h2>Termination</h2>
                <p>Either party may terminate the coaching relationship at any time with written notice. Upon termination, all outstanding fees must be paid, access to the Recovery App will be discontinued, and coaching records will be maintained per our retention policy.</p>

                <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
                <p>In the event of a dispute, we agree to first attempt resolution through good-faith negotiation. If unsuccessful, disputes will be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the laws of [Your State].</p>

                <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time. Significant changes will be communicated via email or website notice. Continued use of our services after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.</p>
