                <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>We use your information to provide coaching services and support, process payments and manage your account, communicate with you about services and appointments, improve our services and user experience, send newsletters and resources with your consent, and comply with legal obligations.</p>
                
                <h2>Confidentiality of Coaching Sessions</h2>
                <p>All information shared during coaching sessions is strictly confidential. We maintain professional standards of confidentiality and will not share session content with third parties except with your explicit written consent, when required by law or court order, when there is imminent danger to yourself or others, or in cases of suspected child abuse or neglect.</p>
                
                <h2>Data Security</h2>
                <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information, including SSL/TLS encryption for all data transmission, secure and encrypted storage of personal data, limited access to information on a need-to-know basis, regular security audits and updates, and HIPAA-compliant practices where applicable.</p>

These services have their own privacy policies and security measures. We carefully select partners who maintain high standards of data protection.</p>
